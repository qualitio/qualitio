* qualitio.core.custommodel *
  custommodel  is django  application that  makes base  foundation for
  model customizations. By  model customization I mean an  easy way of
  extending  execute, store,  require  models fields  and adding  your
  custom validation.

** How customization works **
  Each  customization model defines  it's target  (the model  which it
  will extend). Here's how it works:

  ##########################################################
  from django.db import models

  from qualitio.core.custommodel.models import ModelCustomization
  from qualitio.require.models import Requirement

  class RequirementCustomization(ModelCustomization):
	mark = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True, choices=(
		(1, "Good"),
		(2, "Better"),
		(3, "The best"),
		))

	class Meta:
	    customization_target = Requirement
  ##########################################################

  You're simply telling django which  model is the target to customize
  and    you're   defining    fields   on    your   ModelCustomization
  model.  ModelCustomization will  simply have  OneToOneField  to your
  customization_target.

  ATENTION! Do  not ever, ever create  ModelCustomization instances by
  your self. It is created (or saved) on every CustomizableModel save.
