* filters *
  ver. 0.9.3
  TODO: missing things:
	- not everything's tested

  Reusable django application that makes posible
  to create very flexible Model generic filters.

  The basic idea is to create Form instance for each field
  of model's fields and make possible to join them to sets
  and then join those sets to groups:

  field_name     :    field_value-to-filter AND
  field_name     :    field_value-to-filter AND
  field_name     :    field_value-to-filter

  - OR -

  field_name     :    field_value-to-filter AND
  field_name     :    field_value-to-filter AND
  field_name     :    field_value-to-filter

  - etc ... -

  All filter values in one set are join with AND operator
  all sets values are join with OR operator.

** how does it work **

   Mechanism is based on django.forms. Each model's field is translated
   to FieldFilterForm subclass (with a pretty name) eg. if you have model:

   class Person(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=512)

   filter form that will be generated for this field is:

   class PersonNameFieldFilterForm(FieldFilterForm):
       q = forms.CharField(required=False)

   Application introduces special control forms. Forms params are processed
   in filter.views.filter view. If control field occur it changes number of
   field filters, removes forms control params and redirects to same page
   withuot control params.


** convention **

   Each Form representing the field shoud have:
   - ``construct_Q`` method which returns django's Q object
   - ``field_name`` instance variable with the field name
   - ``field_name_label`` instance variable with label for field filter
   - ALL FieldFilterForm fields MUSN'T be required.

   There are special forms in field filters called control forms
   designed to add field filters, field groups, and removing them.

** field mapping ***

   Mapping between django ORM fields and field filter forms is defined in
   fieldfilters.py module.


** Usage **
   Suppose we have example ``people`` application

   # people/models.py
   class Person(models.Model):
       first_name = models.CharField(max_length=512)
       last_name = models.CharField(max_length=512)


   # people/filters.py
   from people.models import Person
   from qualitio import filter as filterapp

   class PeopleFilter(filterapp.ModelFilter):
       class Meta:
           model = Person
	   # options:
	   # fields = (<field names>)
	   # exclude = (<field names to exclude>)


   # people/views.py
   from people.filters import PeopleFilter

   def people_filter(request):
       filter = PeopleFilter(request.GET)

       has_control_params, params = filter.build_from_params()
       if has_control_params:
           return HttpResponseRedirect('%s?%s' % (request.path, params.urlencode()))

       return render_to_response('people/filter.html', {
           'queryset': filter.qs,
	   'filter': filter,
       })


** Customizations **
   # people/models.py
   class Person(models.Model):
       first_name = models.CharField(max_length=512)
       last_name = models.CharField(max_length=512)


   # people/filters.py
   from django import forms
   from django.db.models import Q

   from people.models import Person
   from qualitio import filter as filterapp


   # it's really important to MAKE FIELDS NOT REQUIRED
   class FirstNameFieldFilter(filterapp.FieldFilterForm):
       startswith = forms.CharField(required=False)
       endswith = forms.CharField(required=False)

       # ``field_name`` variable will be prepared for you by
       # ``FieldFilter.create_form_class`` method so DON'T write it
       # field_name = 'first_name'

       # You can add label here or as an option in ``FieldFilter`` declaration
       # below in ``Filter`` class definition
       field_name_label = 'First name filter'

       def construct_Q(self):
       	   startswith = self.cleaned_data.get('startswith')
       	   endswith = self.cleaned_data.get('endswith')
	   return Q('%s__startswith' % self.field_name : startswith,
	   	    '%s__endswith' % self.field_name : endswith)


   class PeopleFilter(filterapp.ModelFilter):
       class Meta:
           model = Person

       # qustom ``first_name`` field filter with overriden label
       first_name = filters.FieldFilter(FirstNameFieldFilter, label="Field name blah blah")


* actions *

** where the actions came from?

   filter view search for actions in '<model-application-name>.actions' module
   and it pick up every class that is derived from 'qualitio.filter.actions.Action'

   So to make sure you're actions will be founded put them in
   '<your-application>.actions' module.


** how to write an action?
   For example for existing require application

   # code ###############################################
   # qualitio.require.actions
   from django import forms

   from qualitio.require import models
   from qualitio.filter import actions

   class ChangeParentForm(actions.ActionForm):
       parent = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=models.Requirement.objects.all())

   class ChangeParent(actions.Action):
       model = models.Requirement
       label = 'Change parent'
       form_class = ChangeParentForm

       def run_action(self, querydict, queryset, form=None):
           for obj in queryset.all():
               obj.parent = form.cleaned_data.get('parent')
               obj.modified_time = datetime.datetime.now()
               obj.save()
	   return self.success(message='Action done!')
   # code ###############################################

   'form' param is used only if you attach form to your action.
   Form is validated before 'run_actions' runs in 'execute' method.
