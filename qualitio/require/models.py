    This doc assumes you're familiar with django docs at
    http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/instances/#validating-objects

    Implementation of Requirement have three basic abilities:
    * it has additional clean method (clean_dependencies) which checks if there's no
      dependency cycles
    * this additional clean procedure is invoked by 'full_clean' by default.
      First the standard 'full_clean' method is called and then additional
      'clean_dependencies' method is called.
    * calling 'save' doesn't call 'full_clean' but it calls 'clean_dependencies' by
      default

    The reason of this beaviour is to make API safe in case when cycles dependencies
    will be added by a mistake. This means that each time the 'save' method is
    called the 'clean_dependencies' is also called, so the saving operation can take
    awhile. But this is the price for dependency with no cycles safety.
